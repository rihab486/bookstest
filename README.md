I have divided my project into two directories: one for the backoffice using native PHP and the other for the frontend with templates. I have also developed a class diagram between users (User) and books (Books)
. I am using MySQL as the database. I have implemented SQL queries to handle user registration, login, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for books per user.

User authentication is managed using sessions, ensuring secure and efficient management of user accounts.# TestBooks
